<p>Welcome, my name is Reneal. I am an aspiring Software Craftsman, seeking a
full-time position as a Software Developer. I am soon to be a graduate of
Carleton University with a BEng. Computer Systems. I love programming and at the
same time hate it (LOL).Okay, not really hate because hate is such a strong word
but I'm sure you know what I mean. Using the knowledge that I have acquired from
school over the years, I am beginning to tinker with projects in order to become
more aware and creative. I am also a gym enthusiast who enjoys listening to
different genres of music.

I believe that the most intense fight a human will ever have is between the
person they are and the person there are capable of becoming. That is why, my
only competition is with myself and I measure my success by ensuring that each
day is better than the past.
